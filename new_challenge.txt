Time is money.
Just go for it.
Live the moment.
Choose to shine.
Your Time is Now.
No pain, no gain.
I can and I will.
Let your love out.
Too clever is dumb,
Yes, No, Maybe So.
Own less. Do more.
We''re all mad here.
You live only once.
Paint the town red.
Ride like the wind.
No feeling is final,
Kindness is wisdom.
Order brings peace.
What''s done is done.
It''s never too late.
Don’t rush things.
Never stop dreaming.
Time is all we have.
You are your choices.
Follow your own star.
Work hard stay humble,
Every moment matters.
Shine like the stars.
Time discovers truth.
Think outside the box.
What is normal anyway?,
Nobody cares about it.
Don''t worry, be happy.
Think Less. Feel More.
Good things take time.
Time eases all things.
Thoughts rule the world,
Make today awesome!,
My life is my argument.
Dream big. Pray bigger.
Work hard. Stay humble.
Kindness is contagious.
Be true to who you are.
Curiouser and curiouser!,
Tomorrow is another day.
Dance lightly with life.
Enjoy the little things.
Leave no stone unturned.
Enjoy the little things.
The best is yet to come.
You make my heart smile.
Be obsessively grateful.
Faith can move mountains.
Success and nothing less.
Fight till the last gasp.
Better things are coming.
What we think, we become.
Truth is a pathless land.
Never doubt your instinct.
I can, therefore I am.
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
Broken crayons still color.
Beginnings are always messy.
Courage doesn''t always roar.
I think, therefore I am.
And so the adventure begins.
If you want it, work for it.
Never, never, never give up.
If you are good life is good.
Ultimately love is everything,
If there is no wind, row.
You can if you think you can.
Every day is a second chance.
Kindness is always beautiful.
Even monkeys fall from trees.
What you seek is seeking you.
Life is tough but so you are.
Much effort, much prosperity.
Two rights don''t equal a left.
Dream big and dare to fail.
Collect moments – not things.
Feel the fear and do it anyway.
You are amazing. Remember that.
Live the life you’ve dreamed.
Lost time is never found again.
Time brings all things to pass.
Never, never, never give up.
Whatever you are, be a good one.
Impossible is for the unwilling.
Nothing worth having comes easy.
Happiness depends upon ourselves.
Grow through what you go through.
Take the risk or lose the chance.
Do it with passion or not at all.
When nothing goes right, go left.
You will never regret being kind.
You are capable of amazing things.
In the end, only kindness matters.
Don’t stop until you’re proud.
The struggle is part of the story.
If you dream it, you can do it..
Be awesome, be amazing, be you.
She believed she could, so she did.
The past does not equal the future.
It’s pain that changes our lives.
Whatever you are, bo a good one.
If you don’t ask, you don’t get.
Whatever happens, take responsibility,
If not us, who? If not now, when?,
Today a reader, tomorrow a leader,
Stars can’t shine without darkness.
I’m strong because I’ve been weak.
Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.
Everything you can imagine is real.
The best way out is always through.
Good things happen to those who hustle.
At the end of hardship comes happiness.
Forget about style; worry about results.
Whatever you do, do with all your might.
Dream without fear. Love without limits.
Kind people are the best kind of people.
An obstacle is often a stepping stone,
Learn as if you were to live forever.
Technology has to be invented or adopted.
Don’t dream your life, live your dream.
You can do anything you set your mind to.
If it matters to you, you’ll find a way.
We are twice armed if we fight with faith.
Kindness is not an act, it’s a lifestyle.
Wherever you go, go with all your heart.
Technology is teaching us to be human again.
Don’t count the days. Make the days count.
All happiness depends on courage and work,
The human spirit must prevail over technology.
Don’t regret the past, just learn from it.
Change is the end result of all true learning,
Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.
All things are difficult before they are easy.
I never learned from a man who agreed with me.
Don’t wait. The time will never be just right.
